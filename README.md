# Match Plat Design
## Intro
- **Project Overview:** Match Plat is a different kind of puzzle platformer game.  The main gimmick is a mix between a match 3 and platformer game, where the player will play through a match 3 game in tandem with the platformer aspect.  The game's levels will be constructed in the match 3 phase where tiles such as sky, coin, grass, stone, or enemy will be matched together to construct the level.
- **Example Gameplay:** Player boots up the game and goes into endless mode.  In this mode, the player must quickly make matches to be able to navigate the player away from the endlessly encroaching side of the screen.  When finished the player tries campaign mode.  In this part of the game the player starts by building up the level by making matches of 3 as quickly as possible; afterwards platforming and defeating enemies and collecting coins.
- **Rough Schedule Outline:**
	* End of April: Minimum viable product started, platforming works at a basic level and we have a good plan on how to tackle the match 3 component and integrate it with the platforming in a fun way.
	* End of May: Platforming and match 3 integrated, start planning out rest of the summer and finding out what to do with menus, alternate game modes (campaign/endless), and anything else we come up with.
	* Early August: Finish up plans from May, plan out the rest of the year and plan the future of the game.
